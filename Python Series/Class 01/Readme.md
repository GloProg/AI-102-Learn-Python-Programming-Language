## 4. Writing Your First Python Program

Now that Python is installed, let’s write your first Python program.

### Steps:
1. Open a text editor or your Python IDE.
2. Create a new file and name it `hello_world.py`.
3. Write the following code:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. Save the file.
5. Run the program:
   - If you're using the terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder where the file is saved and type:
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```
   - You should see the output:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```
